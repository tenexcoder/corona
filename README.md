Lets analyze the Corona Virus 2 aka SARS-CoV-2 from first principles.

# Molecular Biology Refresher

From High school Biology class we can remember that DNA is made up of 4 nucleic acids guanine, adenine, cytosine and thymine; in RNA, uracil is used in place of thymine in a process called transcription. There are 20 common Amino acids each defined by a sets of three mRNA nucleotides (A, U, G and C). Proteins are a sequences of amino acid chains which fold into a specific shape to define its funtion.

# BioInformatics

We will be using standard python packages for BioInfomratics.

1. Explore CoV-2 genome (done)
2. Compare CoV-2 to other viruses (work in progress)
